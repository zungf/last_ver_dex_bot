*For some reason, The Den (discord server) no longer exists. A new server has been created and will be re-made overtime for those interested in joining. https://discord.gg/FKYrX4X*  
***
This module may be buggy and need some fine tuning. Feel free to let me know what problems you encounter by opening an issue on the repo.
This was originally an update of the original bot from [ruiqimao](https://github.com/ruiqimao/discord.js-music) by [nexu-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-music-v11), but is now a updated version (again) for [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)'s version 11.2^. Fixes deprecated warnings, video playback issues, along with various other add-ons and tweaks to the priors. For support/questions join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cADwxKs) for a faster response than the repo.  

__The commands available are: (default names)__  
* `musichelp [command]`: Displays help text for commands by this addon, or help for a specific command.
* `play <url>|<search string>`: Play audio from YouTube.
* `skip [number]`: Skip a song or multi songs with skip [some number],
* `queue`: Display the current queue.
* `pause`: Pause music playback.
* `resume`: Resume music playback.
* `volume`: Adjust the playback volume between 1 and 200.
* `leave`: Clears the song queue and leaves the channel.
* `clearqueue`: Clears the song queue.
* `owner`: Various owner commands/actions. (W.I.P)

__Permissions:__  
* If `anyoneCanSkip` is true, anyone can skip songs in the queue.
* If `anyoneCanAdjust` is true, anyone can adjust the volume.
* If `ownerOverMember` is true, the set ID of the user (`botOwner`) will over-ride CanAjust and CanSkip.

# Installation
***  
__Installation:__  
1. `npm install discord.js`  
2. `ffmpeg installed` _correctly_ for your OS/Env.
3. `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`
4. `npm install discord.js-musicbot-addon`  

__Common installation issues:__  
__Issue:__ FFMPEG was not found on your system.  
__Fix:__ Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly and set in your PATH variable.  

__Issue:__ Couldn't find an Opus engine.  
__Fix:__ `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  

__Issue:__ [NPM] ERR Cannot read property '0' of undefined  
__Fix:__ `npm i -g npm@4.6.1` or another lower version of npm.  

__Issue:__ TypeError: Invalid non-string/buffer chunk  
__Fix:__ Stop using `ffmpeg-binaries`. Seriously. It's been said enough to use `ffmpeg` itself by now.

__Issue:__ Any node-gyp errors. (build fail, missing cl.exe, etc.)  
__Fix:__ This one is a little more complicated.  
1. Download and install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  
2. New project -> Visual C++  
3. Install Visual C++  

If that doesn't fix your issue;  
1. Download and install the [Windows 8.1 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)  

__Issue:__ `ffluent-ffmpeg` errors.
1. Download and install ffmpeg correctly for your OS/env.
2. Stop asking and make __sure__ it's installed right. You have Google, use it.
